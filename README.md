Highlink is a fully on-chain liquidity protocol that can be implemented on any smart contract enabled blockchain. Highlinkâ€™s solution allows liquidity to be aggregated from diverse sources into a single network, which in turn provides a single endpoint for takers to seamlessly perform multiple token trades in a single blockchain transaction. End users, DApps or any other party only need to query this single endpoint to get the best available rate for their trade. The protocol allows for a wide range of implementation possibilities for liquidity providers, allowing a wide range of entities to contribute liquidity, including end users, decentralized exchanges and other decentralized protocols. On the taker side, end users, cryptocurrency wallets, and smart contracts can perform instant and trustless token trades at the best rates available amongst the sources. The on-chain instant exchange property is critical for enabling a wide range of decentralized use cases, including financial protocols and cryptocurrency payments. One would expect different implementations of Highlink protocol on other public blockchains to make onchain instant exchanges to be available for various use cases and applications on these blockchains.
